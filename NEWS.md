# Liftoff Changelog #

## Liftoff 1.2 - March 28, 2014 ##

### New Features ###

* Add command line flags. You can now pass a set of flags to the `liftoff`
  executable to override specific configurations at run time - [JP
  Simard][liftoff#126]
* Add `strict_prompts` option. This configuration option and the corresponding
  `--[no-]strict-prompts` command line flag tell `liftoff` to only prompt you
  for options that don't have default values set. This allows you to set values
  at run time and skip the prompt altogether. - [JP Simard][liftoff#127]
* Add configuration for setting up Run Script phases. This replaces the
  `install_todo_script` configuration key with a much more flexible
  `run_script_phases` key. By overriding this key, you can install any
  arbitrary script phases as long as you're providing a template for them.
  - [Mikael Bartlett][liftoff#120] ([Thanks to Magnus Ottosson][liftoff#118])
* Reluctantly allow the use of tabs for indentation. Even though my conscience
  protested, we've added a `use_tabs` key to the configuration. Enabling this
  will configure the project to use tabs instead of spaces. Note that this
  doesn't change the spacing in the default templates, so if you override this
  you will probably want to override those as well. - [Gordon
  Fontenot][liftoff#125] ([Thanks to Magnus Ottosson][liftoff#119])

### Changes ###

* Enable some more warnings by default. - [Gordon Fontenot][liftoff#134]
* Handle key deprecations a bit more gracefully. - [Gordon
  Fontenot][liftoff#133]
* Stop treating all plists as though they are the Info.plist. Previously, any
  plist that was added as a template was being treated as though it was the
  Info.plist for that target. We're now being more explicit about matching that
  file, and linking all other plists properly. - [Gordon Fontenot][liftoff#122]

### Bug Fixes ###

* Set the deployment target at the project level. This mimics the behavior
  when creating a new project with Xcode. - [Gordon Fontenot][liftoff#123]

## Liftoff 1.1.1 - March 18, 2014 ##

### Bug Fixes ###

* Remove `OTHER_LDFLAGS` setting from app target. This was being set to a
  blank string, which caused it to override any xcconfig files added to the
  target. - Gordon Fontenot ([Thanks to @frosty][liftoff#111])
* Prevent RubyGems from loading. In some installs, users were seeing crashes
  due to the wrong Xcodeproj native C extensions being loaded. Current theory
  is that RVM is doing some loadpath stuff for gems that is overriding our
  loadpaths. The simple fix that seems to solve the issue is to completely
  disable RubyGems while running Liftoff. - Gordon Fontenot ([Thanks to
  @iOSDevil, Jim Rutherford, and @endoze][liftoff#113])

## Liftoff 1.1 - March 14, 2014 ##

### New Features ###

* Allow users to override templates. Now users can create templates inside
  `.liftoff/templates` at the local or user level in order to add custom
  templates, or override the default templates. - Gordon Fontenot
* Add support for CocoaPods. By default, Liftoff will generate a default
  podfile, and run `pod install` inside the project directory. This can be
  disabled inside the `.liftoffrc`. - JP Simard
* Add default pods for test target. By default, Liftoff will install `Specta`,
  `Expecta`, and `OCMock` for the test target. This can be overridden by using
  a custom template for the `Podfile` - Gordon Fontenot
* Add `company_identifier` property to configuration. We will now prompt for
  the company identifier on new project creation. The default for this prompt
  is generated by normalizing the provided company name, unless there is a
  default set by the `.liftoffrc` - Gordon Fontenot ([Thanks to Tony
  DiPasquale][liftoff#94])
* Open new projects after creation - Mark Adams

### Changes ###

* Application target defaults to portrait orientation only. - Mark Adams
* Automatically default to the current user's name. We no longer prompt for
  the user's name, instead defaulting to the name provided by the system. This
  can still be overridden by a `.liftoffrc` - Gordon Fontenot (Thanks to [Mike
  Burns][liftoff#80])
* Remove explicit framework linking. Since modules are enabled, we don't need
  to manually link frameworks anymore. - Gordon Fontenot
* Prefer new @import over #import - Mark Adams

[liftoff#80]: https://github.com/thoughtbot/liftoff/issues/80

### Bug Fixes ###

* Install ruby files into rubylib instead of lib. Previously, Homebrew was
  linking these into /usr/local/lib, which caused warnings when running `brew
  audit` - Gordon Fontenot ([Thanks to Ashton Williams][liftoff#107])
* Use `https` for GitHub URL in homebrew formula. This was causing warnings
  when running `brew audit` - Gordon Fontenot ([Thanks to Ashton Williams][liftoff#107])
* Print a nicer error if the directory exists. Previously, this was throwing
  an ugly ruby stack trace. - Gordon Fontenot ([Thanks to Mark
  Adams][liftoff#87])
* Trap interrupt during option input. Previously, this was throwing an ugly
  ruby stack trace. - Gordon Fontenot ([Thanks to George
  Brocklehurst][liftoff#81])
* Set SDKROOT at the project level - Gordon Fontenot ([Thanks to Tony
  DiPasquale][liftoff#97])
